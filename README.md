# image_to_ascii
converts .bmp images to ascii character art

# instructions
1. create a .bmp file using any image editor
my prefered editor is gimp in which you convert the image to grayscale and then rename the image to input.bmp
2. make sure the file is named input.bmp then replace the file inside the project folder to your file
3. run the executable by running ./image_to_ascii in unix terminal
4. the output.txt file will contain the ascii character art
